  Welcome to the very first Emberginners workshop hosted by simplabs!

  For the people that joined us yesterday they will know who we are, but I'll introduce myself again for anyone that couldn't make it!

  My name is Jessica, I work for simplabs and I'm a member of the Ember Core Learning Team.

  And this is Chris, who also works at simplabs and is also a member of the Ember Core Learning Team

  (other helpers?)

  These slides are available on this first link, but more importantly we also have this cool thing called a Training Buddy on this second link. I want everyone to open this now.

  The Training buddy will have a bunch of helpful information including all the commands and code that we're going to be using today so you can just copy and paste from there. If everyone has it open then we can get started
