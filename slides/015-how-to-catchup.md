notes: |
  Because we started our app today by cloning a repo that means that we have already setup a series of "checkpoints" that will allow you to catch up with the workshop if you fall behind.

  In our repo we are using tags to make these checkpoints. It's not 100% necessary for us to explain exactly what a tag is in git land they are super useful

  we need to use the `git checkout` command from inside the web app directory

#### Catching up on exercises

If you ever get stuck, you can use `git checkout` to catch up:

```bash
git checkout 2a
```
