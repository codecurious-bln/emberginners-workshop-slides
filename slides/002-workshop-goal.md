notes: |
  This is a workshop to teach those who have never programmed before (or at least never programmed with JavaScript - the programming language of the web) a few basics in web and JavaScript development.

  when you build web applications you also use HTML and CSS but we will only be touching on those today

  We will also give an introduction into the JavaScript framework EmberJS which we will use to get started super quickly and build our very first web application.
