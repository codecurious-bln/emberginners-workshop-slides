  Variables in JavaScript provide a way to **store** and to **retrieve** words, numbers and other more complex things in your program.
  A variable acts as a container for these so-called _values_. You can _declare_ a variable and fill it in with a value by using a dedicated keyword and the _assign_ operator `=`.

  In the scope of this workshop we will learn about one particular variable keyword called `let`. If you continue to learn more about JavaScript after this workshop, you might encounter other variable keywords as well, but for now, we can do everything we want to achieve in this course by focussing on `let` only.

  If you, for example, wanted to create a variable that stores your favorite color, can write the following:

  ```js
  let color = 'purple';
  ```

  This line does 3 things:

  - It creates a new variable, a container for any word or number you want to store
  - It fills in the variable `color` with the word `purple`
  - It allows you to retrieve the word `purple` any time again in your code by reading from the variable `color`

  You can choose almost any word that comes to your mind, when naming a variable. It's also possible to include numbers in your variable name.
