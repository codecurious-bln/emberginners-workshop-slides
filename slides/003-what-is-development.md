  Learning more about web development allows you to build your own websites and web apps that you can publish online and share with the world! If you ever had the idea for a new project or a tool that can be used online, then this workshop is just for you.

  As someone who builds websites and web apps, you're using different technologies or so-called **programming languages**. As we mentioned already, the main languages used on the web are **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. In the scope of this course we will focus on JavaScript, but if you have interest in learning more about HTML and CSS, we'd like to encourage you to follow your interest. We can also share more materials on these technologies for further learning at the end of the workshop and we are always open to help you in the future if you keep in touch

  With JavaScript as one of the main languages of the web, once we learn how to read and write JavaScript code, we can build our own **interactive** web experiences.

  Many websites nowadays heavily depend on JavaScript to run. These websites which are mainly based on JavaScript programs are also called **single-page applications**. Examples for popular single-page applications online are [gmail.com](https://gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com).

  Building single-page applications allows us to build modern websites, which feel faster and are more responsive than the traditional websites we are used to from the 90s.

  If you're wondering that the difference is between a "traditional" web page and a single page application you can see that difference on the screen now. The left screen is the more "traditional" web page that you can see it kind of "starting over" every time you navigate around the website. This is what is call "server rendered". Single page applications are very different, the difference may seem subtle but you will notice that the app on the right seems "smoother" and doesn't jump around when you navigate to different pages. This is some of the cool stuff that Ember can do
