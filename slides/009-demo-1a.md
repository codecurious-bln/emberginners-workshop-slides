  - Open Chrome (it's best to use chrome so we're all using the same thing)
  - right click anywhere in the window, select "Inspect"
  - click on the "Console" tab
  - Type into the window right next to the small arrow: `alert("Hello World!")` and hit Enter.

  - Type into the window right next to the small arrow `console.log("Hello World!")` and hit Enter. What happens now?
