### Catching up on exercises

Link to the demo app we provide for you to catch up anytime:

```bash
git add upstream git@github.com:simplabs/emberginners-workshop-app.git
git fetch upstream
```

If you ever get stuck, type the name of the next exercise after commanding `git checkout`:

```bash
git checkout 2a
```
