  Ember is a specific **JavaScript framework** that allows us to build fast single-page applications. As a framework it provides us with a way to write JavaScript code to create our app, but it also provides us with many useful tools to do so. We will learn more about what these tools are about at the workshop.

  If you were here yesterday for the install party you will have already built your first ember app! when you ran `ember new` it created a whole bunch of files for you that we currently have no idea what they do ðŸ™ˆ most of those files are empty right now and they are like the scaffolding of our app, just creating folders for us so that we know where to put stuff when building our app.

  Ok so our auto generated app was a bit simple, let's look at some of example of ember apps in the wild!

  Ember or more specifically EmberJS (JS stands for **J** ava **S** cript) is a tool that helps you build entire websites using JavaScript. It itself is written in JavaScript and it provides different language patterns to you to make it more easy to manage your code and build your web app. It is also called a JavaScript **framework**, as it provides the foundation on which you can build up your own program.

  Traditional websites from many years ago, used to be built on HTML and CSS only - two languages that have been used since the early days of the web. Many modern websites are mostly built based on JavaScript alone, using frameworks like EmberJS. JavaScript websites or so-called **web applications** gained popularity in the last years, since they can be viewed faster than traditional websites and using them feels more intuitive.

  An example of a classic website is a news website such as [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk) or [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de). These provide content for you to read but leave almost no room for interaction. Their main goal is presentation of information.

  An example for a modern web application is a service like [Gmail](https://gmail.com) or [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com).
  Features like your message editor or the message search integrate into the website smoothly and allow user interaction, which means they animate, provide you live suggestions for words you want to use as you're typing or highlight missing words without you having to reload the page.

  When building web applications, the EmberJS framework supports you by integrating into JavaScript code seamlessly (and which you'll be writing to build your app).
  Ember helps you to manage JavaScript files, allows you to edit them and run them in the browser. To achieve this, Ember will generate new JavaScript files for you on a few short commands, we will learn about later. The JavaScript files generated by Ember can then be modified further in your text editor to build your app.

  The app we'll be building today will in the end look something like this:

  In this section we'll learn some of the basic principles of Ember and how we can use an important tool - the Ember CLI (CLI stands for **C**ommand **L**ine **I** nterface) - to make building our application more easy.
