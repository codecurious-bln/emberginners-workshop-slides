notes: |
  Before we used git to clone our repo we were writing some Javascript directly in the browser. This is not very useful because we can't get our users to do this any time we want to run Javascript on their machines ðŸ˜‚

  Instead we want to be able to save a collection of JavaScript actions in a single file that will execute when the page is loaded. Let's do this now

  If you go to **Step 2** in the training buddy app we are now looking at doing Exercise 2b

  - Open your text editor
  - Open the new folder that was created when we used `git clone`
  - Open the file `/public/demo/demo-2b.html` in your text editor
  - start the server using `npm start`
  - Investigate the `<script type="text/javascript"></script>` section
  - Fill in a snippet of JavaScript code from the previous exercise into the snippet below the `// comment`
  - Reload the page in the browser. What do you see?
  - Trouble with the exercise? Open `/public/demo/demo-2b-solution.html` in your editor and browser
