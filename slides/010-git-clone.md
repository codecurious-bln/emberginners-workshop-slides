  To clone a git repo you can run the following:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/simplabs/emberginners-workshop-app.git
  ```

  Something to note when you're cloning a repo that uses npm, you need to install the repos depenedencies before you can do anything

  ```bash
  cd emberginners-workshop-app

  npm install
  ```
